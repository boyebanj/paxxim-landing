# Paxxim Landing Page

This repository contains the marketing/landing page for **Paxxim**, the property management application.

The production web app lives on `app.paxxim.com`. This repo includes the static landing page displayed on `paxxim.com`.

```
./
├─ src/            # Source HTML/CSS/JS
├─ assets/         # Images, fonts, icons
├─ scripts/        # Build or deployment scripts
├─ dist/           # Built output for hosting
└─ README.md       # Overview and development instructions
```

## Development

1. Edit the contents in `src/`.
2. Use any preferred static-site tooling (e.g., Vite, Parcel) to bundle resources.
3. Deploy the contents of `dist/` (or directly from `src/`) to your static host.

This repository is intentionally lightweight. Feel free to extend the structure as the marketing site grows.
